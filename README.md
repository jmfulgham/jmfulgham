I'm a full stack engineer that specializes in test driven development.
Previously I was ...
 * A full stack software engineer with [Unstoppable Domains](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains), where I led the charge to increase testing coverage by 40% my first two months of employment
 * A front end engineering consultant with [Formidable Labs](https://github.com/formidablelabs), a NearForm company, where I played a pivotal role in slashing a client's average page render time from 5 seconds to just 137 milliseconds. 
 * A software engineer with [Home Depot](https://github.com/homedepot), I honed my skills in test driven development, and scaling with Google Cloud Platform and Kubernetes.

Currently I'm looking for a position where I can leverage my skills in React, Typescript and Node. Feel free to reach out to me at [mo@jaimo.net](mailto:mo@jaimo.net)
